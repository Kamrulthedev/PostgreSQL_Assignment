## Description
This project is a simple database management system for a university that utilizes PostgreSQL. It includes functionalities to manage students, courses, and enrollments, allowing users to perform various operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.


1. What is PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is designed to handle a wide range of workloads, from small single-machine applications to large internet-facing applications with many concurrent users. It is known for its robustness, extensibility, and compliance with SQL standards. PostgreSQL supports advanced data types and performance optimization features, making it a popular choice for developers and businesses. Its key features include:

ACID Compliance: Ensures reliable transactions and data integrity.
Support for Advanced Data Types: Includes JSON, XML, hstore, and more.
Extensibility: Allows users to create custom data types, operators, and functions.
Concurrency: Implements Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) to handle multiple transactions without locking the database.
Rich Ecosystem: Supports various programming languages and has a large community contributing to its development.
Overall, PostgreSQL is favored for its flexibility, performance, and reliability, making it suitable for a variety of applications and industries.
